The three-day virtual Early Career Leadership Academy (ECLA) of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) was held this week. After a year-long delay due to the ongoing pandemic, the event was a wonderful experience of growth, learning, and relationship building.

Effective Leadership
======
Prior to becoming a research scientist at NCAR, I was a broadcast meteorologist delivering weather forecasts on television. I would read headlines about new climate change research results, and while I enjoyed my job as a broadcast meteorologist, I wished I could generate new findings and conduct research. Today, various news media outlets published articles about our recent study on climate change in Alaska and projected increases in organized convection.



Leadership in a Crisis
------
One of our sessions focused on leadership during crisis situations, which many meteorologists and scientists will inevitably face at some point in their careers. Whether it be due to an extreme weather event, political unrest, disease outbreak, or social movements, understanding how to be an effective leader during crises is an important skillset to build. 

>You should not be exchanging business cards in the middle of a disaster. You should already have those contacts in your Rolodex. - Dr. Claire Knox

Our speakers had experience in emergency situations and provided valuable tips and perspectives. A key takeaway was that we should be building relationships with our community and constituents prior to when disaster strikes. Trust can be built by sharing personal details about our lives or sharing experiences when the sun is shinning. Straightforward messaging is also effective (e.g., Take Shelter Now!) not only for the public, but for emergency managers as well. Dr. Bob McBride also suggested bringing in a "non-expert" during disaster situations to deliver a message if they are well-trusted by the community, including religious leaders or football coaches.

Being an Ally and Advocate

Building a Community within the Weather, Water, and Climate Fields
------
In addition to gaining skills and learning about how to be effective leaders, another valuable aspect of ECLA was building relationships with other early career scientists that we will be colleagues with for potentially the rest of our careers. During ECLA, we played Jackbox games together after the events of the day, speed networking event, and interacted across Gather.town. According to the creators, 

>Gather.town is web-conferencing software like Zoom, but with the added component of seeing the virtual "room" you and others are occupying, and with the ability to move around and interact with other participants based on your locations in the room, just like real life.

The software was incredibly fun, provided us the ability to "walk" around, socialize, and play games together. I had a ton of fun building the environment with several rooms that included a recess area, a rooftop lounge, coffee shop, graduation center, and a spaceship! The game "battle draw" was a big hit, where we were grouped into two teams and played competitive Pictionary. Som of the resultant drawings and guesses were pretty hilarious.
