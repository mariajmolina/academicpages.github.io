I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) Spring Forecasting Experiment (SFE) this week. Our group got to try out several new experimental models for prediction of severe thunderstorms alongside operational meteorologists. 

Virtual attendance

Although the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions are easing across the United States as more of the population is vaccinated, many workshops and conferences remain virtual this summer for public safety. This also included the 2021 NOAA HWT Spring Forecasting Experiment. While I don't work as a forecaster of severe thunderstorms, I have wanted to attend the HWT SFE for some time now to learn about how research can help forecasters do their jobs effectively and learn more about our weather and climate system. While many of us would prefer to see each other in person, it was still wonderful to see some familiar faces and meet new folks that work within NOAA or other organizations, including some international institutions.

What is the NOAA HWT SFE?
------
According to the [NOAA HWT](https://hwt.nssl.noaa.gov/),
>The NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed is a joint project of the National Weather Service and the National Severe Storms Laboratory. The HWT provides a conceptual framework and a physical space to foster collaboration between research and operations to test and evaluate emerging technologies and science for NWS operations. The HWT was borne from the “Spring Program” which, for the last decade, has been used to test and evaluate new forecast models, techniques, and products to support NWS Storm Prediction Center forecast operations.

Typically, the testbed is run in person in Norman, Oklahoma during the late spring season, when severe thunderstorms are at their climatological peak across the United States (specifically, the plains).
