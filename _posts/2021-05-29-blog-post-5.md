I had the wonderful opportunity to attend the NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) Spring Forecasting Experiment (SFE) this week. Our group got to try out several new experimental models for prediction of severe thunderstorms alongside operational meteorologists. 

Virtual attendance
======
Although the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions are easing across the United States as more of the population is vaccinated, many workshops and conferences remain virtual this summer for public safety. This also included the 2021 NOAA HWT Spring Forecasting Experiment. While I don't work as a forecaster of severe thunderstorms, I have wanted to attend the HWT SFE for some time now to learn about how research can help forecasters do their jobs effectively and learn more about our weather and climate system. While many of us would prefer to see each other in person, it was still wonderful to see some familiar faces and meet new folks that work within NOAA or other organizations, including some international institutions.

What is the NOAA HWT SFE?
------
According to the [NOAA HWT](https://hwt.nssl.noaa.gov/),
>The NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed is a joint project of the National Weather Service and the National Severe Storms Laboratory. The HWT provides a conceptual framework and a physical space to foster collaboration between research and operations to test and evaluate emerging technologies and science for NWS operations. The HWT was borne from the “Spring Program” which, for the last decade, has been used to test and evaluate new forecast models, techniques, and products to support NWS Storm Prediction Center forecast operations.

Typically, the testbed is run in person in Norman, Oklahoma during the late spring season, when severe thunderstorms are at their climatological peak across the United States (specifically, the plains).

The NOAA HWT SFE consisted of morning and afternoon sessions. The morning sessions focused on evaluating our experimental forecasts from the previous day and some subjective evaluations of how our forecasts compared among different groups participating in the NOAA HWT SFE. For example, some groups were allowed to use all products while others were not, and the forecasts from these groups were then compared. We also discussed what some apparent failures of specific products were evident based on the severe weather setup from the previous day. Severe thunderstorm events generally consist of certain environmental conditions, mesoscale interactions, and synoptic-scale patterns that can advect favorable environments, making for challenging forecasts that may not be captured accurately by specific numerical models or products.

Machine learning presence at the 2021 NOAA HWT SFE
------
As machine learning continues proliferating in the atmospheric and climate sciences, it was exciting to test several products available at the 2021 NOAA HWT SFE. Some products focused on prediction of specific severe hazards (e.g., tornadoes, large hail, damaging winds) and others provided pinpoint forecasts of local storm reports or convective mode. At NCAR, there are several ongoing efforts that apply machine learning to severe thunderstorm problems occurring within the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory and the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory. Neural networks have been applied already to severe thunderstorm [hazard predictions](https://news.ucar.edu/132793/neural-network-improves-forecasts-severe-storm-hazards).

Societal danger of severe thunderstorms
------
Severe thunderstorms pose a dangerous threat to society and can cause billions of dollars in losses from large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes. While certain severe events produce localized damage, certain events can also be long-tracked and impact very large regions. For example, last August 10, 2020, a damaging wind event associated with convection, also known as a derecho, [devasted parts of the Midwest](https://www.weather.gov/dvn/summary_081020). These events can leave structural and personal scars in communities that can last a lifetime.
