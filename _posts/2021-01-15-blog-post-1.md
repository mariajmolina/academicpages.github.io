I delivered my first core science keynote at the 101st annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society, titled "How Python and Machine Learning Enable Advances in Earth Science."

Virtual conference
======
The 101st AMS annual meeting was held virtually, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The conference featured numerous pre-recorded presentations, lightning summary talks, and live panels and poster sessions. My core science keynote was delivered live and I had the honor of talking about how python and machine learning are transforming how we do Earth science.
