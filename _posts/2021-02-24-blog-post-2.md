Our paper was recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, _Climate Dynamics,_ on projected changes to organized thunderstorms over Alaska. These changes are projected to occur because of rising temperatures, decreased sea ice, and added moisture available for thunderstorms.

The journal article I contributed to can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-020-05606-7).

A different perspective
======
Prior to becoming a research scientist at NCAR, I was a broadcast meteorologist delivering weather forecasts on television. I would read headlines about new climate change research results, and while I enjoyed my job as a broadcast meteorologist, I wished I could generate new findings and conduct research. Today, various news media outlets published articles about our recent study on climate change in Alaska and projected increases in organized convection.

Climate Change, Alaska, and Thunderstorms
------
My role in the project was to identify where the moisture that contributed to the development of thunderstorms originated from, and whether there was an increase in this moisture due to reduced sea ice surrounding Alaska. I performed this analysis using the NOAA HYSPLIT model, which is a trajectory model that can be used to determine the origins of air parcels. While I had used the model throughout my Ph.D. research, this was my first time applying it to high-resolution WRF model output and across a high-latitude area. I learned how to convert the WRF model output into a format that was friendly to HYSPLIT and ran HYSPLIT on our NCAR supercomputer, [Cheyenne](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne).

Our study showed that moisture can indeed originate from these newly exposed moisture sources as a result of sea ice loss. This has implications for thunderstorm development. Warmer temperatures and added moisture can lead to more thunderstorms, which can produce heavy rains across areas that are not accustomed to receiving it, potentially leading to floods. Lightning from thunderstorms could also potentially start wildfires. These topics were of interest to media, given the human-caused warming of our planet that is ongoing and the unique vulnerability of high-latitude regions.

What is it like to be interviewed?
------
Being interviewed for print news stories is fun and relatively laid back. Unlike for televised platforms, print media interviews are typically done over the phone and in this case, lasted only a few minutes. The reporters had already received a detailed [press release](https://news.ucar.edu/132777/alaska-thunderstorms-may-triple-climate-change) from our communications department and were therefore up-to-date on the key findings of our research. Reporters were primarily making sure that they understood the key findings of the research, asked clarifying questions or if there were details they missed, and wanted to be able to quote us for their story.
