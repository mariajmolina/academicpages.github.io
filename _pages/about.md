I am a research scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, working within the Cooperative Agreement To Analyze variabiLity, change and predictabilitY in the earth SysTem (CATALYST) and Climate Change Research section of the Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory. [CATALYST](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/projects/catalyst/) is a sustained commitment between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to perform foundational research toward advancing a robust understanding of modes of variability using models, observations, and process studies.
