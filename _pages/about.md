I am a research scientist at the **National Center for Atmospheric Research** ([NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/)), working within the Cooperative Agreement To Analyze variabiLity, change and predictabilitY in the earth SysTem ([CATALYST](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/projects/catalyst/)) group and Climate Change Research section of the Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory ([CGD](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/)).

[//]: # (My research is conducted with a highly collaborative team, made up of leading-senior to early-career scientists. I collaborate on research that spans across three primary areas: i extending Earth system predictability of modes of variability and their associated impacts, ii understanding modes of variability and their interactions, and iii detection of mesoscale to synoptic scale phenomena associated with precipitation extremes and their connection to modes of variability. I use tools include Earth system models, machine learning and deep learning, and signal processing methods.)
