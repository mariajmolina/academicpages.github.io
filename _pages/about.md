I am a research scientist at the **National Center for Atmospheric Research** (NCAR), working within the Cooperative Agreement To Analyze variabiLity, change and predictabilitY in the earth SysTem (CATALYST) and Climate Change Research section of the _Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory_. 

[CATALYST](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/projects/catalyst/) represents a sustained commitment between the Department of Energy (DOE) and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to perform foundational research toward advancing a robust understanding of modes of climate variability using models, observations, and process studies.
