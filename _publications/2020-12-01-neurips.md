Abstract: Previous studies have shown that increases in flash rates detected in ground-based lightning data can be a precursor to severe weather hazards. Lightning data from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) aboard the GOES-R satellite is not part of an operational model used by forecasters and is underutilized in severe storm research. The Advanced Baseline Imagerâ€™s (ABI) visible imagery also shows cloud features, such as overshooting tops and above-anvil cirrus plumes, which have been associated with severe weather hazards. We introduce a generative video frame prediction methodology using a convolutional recurrent autoencoder, to leverage these spatio-temporal patterns in GLM and ABI, along with ground-based severe weather data. An initial case study is presented and contrasted with a time series classification of GLM data. Through this study, we seek to highlight the value of GLM data to assist meteorologists in time-constrained nowcasting (15-30 minute lead time) of severe hazards.
