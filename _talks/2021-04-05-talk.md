Recent computational advances have enabled substantial progress in large-data analysis and machine learning. These tools can be leveraged to discover patterns within the Earth climate system and to create more skillful long-range predictions for societal benefit. This seminar will highlight several applications of unsupervised and supervised learning methods for climate science, including signal processing and self-organizing maps. The first demonstrated application involves analysis of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, where wavelet analysis reveals substantial changes to the characteristics of sea surface temperature patterns across the equatorial Pacific as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slows. The second application involves the use of self-organizing maps to uncover large-scale patterns upstream of precipitation over the United States (US). Finally, a planned use of convolutional neural networks for subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction of precipitation patterns over the US will be discussed. The focus during this seminar will be on the application of these methods for climate analysis.
